Press w for rotating the wheel in one direction, let the wheel gain speed and then press s so that the wheel start rotating in opposite direction causing the cube to topple. Now to continuously topple in one direction when the cube is midway in the air just press the key responsible for rotating the wheel in opposite sense and repeat the process. In this repository i have attached my cube.sdf and a video demonstrating the motion of the cube.
